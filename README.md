Device to ratio candy for 7 days in the week.

- Printed housing which houses a wheel with 7 pockets.
- Servomotor acts as indexing mechanism. A latch mechanism prevents reversing the wheel.
- Uses Arduino Uno, RTC on a button cell battery to track the time & date, a buzzer & button to control the device
